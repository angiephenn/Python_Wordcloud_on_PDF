# Objective
Visually represent the frequency of different words in a PDF text using a word cloud.

The provided code aims to generate a word cloud visualization from a PDF file containing text. It first opens the PDF file, extracts the text content from each page, and combines them into a single string. Using the extracted text, a word cloud is generated using the 'BuPu' colormap. The word cloud is then displayed using matplotlib, with the plot configured to a specific size and title.
